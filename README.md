# Cruzbit-Tree

A simple directory-system implementation for Cruzbit

## Why does this exist?

You can very simply populate a directory like this:

- Cruzbit
    - links
        - dev
            - whitepaper
                - "some text here"

just by sending a transaction from `your-public-key` to `Cruzbit/links/dev/whitepaper000000000000000=` with memo `some text here`

## Getting started

Refer to the [Cruzbit](https://github.com/jstnryan/cruzbit/tree/master/client) core for getting started with cruzbit and getting and sending tokens.
